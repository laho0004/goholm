            Dining at Göholm unfolds across two distinct rooms, each carrying its
            own quiet charm. The grand dining hall seats sixteen and is laid with
            beautifully preserved, traditional tableware — a setting made for
            long meals, conversation and the gentle formality of the manor’s
            heritage.

            room offers a more intimate setting with a single table for coffee,
            light meals, or quiet moments.

            The kitchens at Göholm support the rhythm of the house with spaces
            designed for both daily use and larger gatherings. On the ground

            cooking and shared preparation.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-16">
            On the dining floor, a dedicated serving kitchen offers a bright and
            functional area for arranging meals before they reach the table,
            allowing preparation and service to flow seamlessly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Together, these kitchens reflect the manor’s practical and welcoming

              The fireplace room is one of the manor’s most atmospheric spaces,
              shaped by soft light, deep colours and the quiet presence of books
              and well-worn furniture. Two large sofas gather around a low marble
              table, where candlelight reflects gently across its surface and
              creates a calm setting for long conversations. The built-in
              bookcases, filled with volumes collected over generations, soften
              the room and give it a sense of continuity and lived-in character.
              At the far end, the restored fireplace warms the space for relaxed
              evenings together.
            </p>

            <div>
              <p class="mb-16">
                The glow from the fire blends with the room’s darker tones,
                creating a sense of intimacy and ease that unfolds naturally as
                the evening progresses.
              </p>

              <p>
                The fireplace room sits just beyond the small bar salon, allowing
                movement between the two spaces to feel unhurried and harmonious.
                Together, they form a sequence of rooms made for gathering,
                lingering and enjoying the quiet rhythm of the manor.

                The piano room is a bright and spacious setting where music, play
                and relaxation come together. The dark, classic piano stands as a
                natural focal point, surrounded by large windows that draw in
                daylight and give the room a calm, open atmosphere.

              <p>
                A generous sofa creates a relaxed area around a low table, where
                a backgammon board often lies ready for quiet breaks and unhurried
                moments.

              <p>
                Its open layout makes it a natural gathering place in the house,
                a space for playing a game, listening to music or simply gazing
                out at the landscape through the tall windows. The room feels
                both informal and atmospheric, carrying the same quiet rhythm
                that defines the manor.

            The main staircase forms one of the manor’s quiet transitions between
            the rooms. From both the fireplace lounge and the dining room, the
            staircase opens into a bright landing, where tall windows bring in
            soft daylight and highlight the dark, carved wood of the balustrade.
            The space carries a sense of movement and calm at the same time,
            shaped by old portraits, small details and the gentle echoes of the
            house.
          </p>

          <p>
            From here, the stairs lead down to the entrance hall and up to the
            floor above, where the bedrooms and an additional sitting room are
            located. A vintage record player stands on the landing, adding a
            touch of character and reminding visitors of the house’s layered
            history. The staircase connects the manor’s social spaces with its
            quieter private rooms and gives a natural rhythm to the way the house
            is lived in.

          if ready for guests to mix a drink before settling in for the evening.
        </p>

        <p>
          From here, the room opens directly into the large fireplace lounge,

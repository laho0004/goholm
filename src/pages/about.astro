        <h1 class="mb-32">The History of Göholm</h1>

            <p>
              Göholm’s history dates back to the early 18th century, when the estate was
              established under the Siöstierna family. In 1790, Johan af Puke rebuilt the
              main house as a stately stone manor, forming the foundation of the building
              seen today.
            </p>

            <p>
              For generations, Göholm has functioned as a gathering place shaped by
              agriculture, hunting and land stewardship. Today, the estate is operated
              through a long-term lease with the purpose of preserving, maintaining and
              actively using the property.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="space-y-24 max-w-[420px] md:justify-self-end">
            <p>
              Daily operations are managed by the foundation, supported by a dedicated team
              responsible for the land, buildings and surrounding landscape.
            </p>

            <p>
              The combination of natural surroundings and historic architecture creates a
              setting where past and present meet in balance. Göholm remains defined by
              simplicity, quiet beauty and continuity, offering an environment that
              supports focus, reflection and meaningful gatherings.

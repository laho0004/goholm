          <p>
            Göholm's history dates back to the early 18th century under the
            Siöstierna family, and in 1790 Johan af Puke rebuilt the main house
            as the stately stone manor that forms the foundation of the estate
            today. For generations, Göholm has been a gathering place for those
            who value nature, craftsmanship and the calm of an authentic manor
            setting.
          </p>

          <p>
            The estate is leased with the purpose of maintaining and caring for
            the property. The lease includes hunting, farmland and buildings,
            all guided by continuity and respect for the landscape and its
            heritage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, Göholm unites nature, history and active land stewardship.
            Forests, farmland, hunting, fishing and outdoor experiences are
            managed with great care for the landscape and the estate's legacy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The combination of natural surroundings and historic architecture
            creates a setting where past and present meet in balance — and
            where the spirit of Göholm is defined by simplicity, quiet beauty
            and a deep sense of place.
